# fsm-int-real
Finite State Machine based string parser to detect valid integer and real numbers

This is a demo C++ file demonstrating unit test cases and integrated test cases for the above use case. The testing tool used is "catch.hpp" and older version of [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)

## Instructions
1. Download code and execute `make unit` command to generate `fsm.unit`
    ```bash
      $> make unit
    ```
2. Run the unit test cases 
    ```bash
      $> ./fsm.unit
    ```
3. Then execute `make` to generate `fsm.out`
    ```bash
      $> make unit
    ```
4. Run the sample cases for the integrated tests
    ```bash
      $> ./run_samples.sh
    ```
